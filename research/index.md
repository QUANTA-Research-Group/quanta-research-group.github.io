There are multiple initiatives, platforms and open resources in quantum computing, but it is not always easy to transform this scattered knowledge into meaningful learning experiences or useful solutions to real problems. At QUANTA we develop algorithms, tools and interdisciplinary approaches that integrate research and training in quantum computing. Our goal is to facilitate access to this field, create reusable educational materials and promote a deep understanding of its fundamentals and applications.
